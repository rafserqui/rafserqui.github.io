This paper investigates how changes to the market structure in the natural gas production sector would impact natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs) and regional economies over time. We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model with a monopolistic supply of natural gas by an LDC that faces a capacity constraint that can be changed via investments. We incorporate two types of capital that differ in the energy they use to be powered. The production sector uses capital services from different energy sources and labor. We calibrate the model to 12 major Brazilian LDCs to explore the effects of a reduction in the price of natural gas. We find that a 5% reduction in the price of natural gas leads to significant increases in natural gas consumption, with a median value of 80% across LDCs. We distinguish between short and long-run effects and find that long-run effects are significantly mitigated when the price of other energy sources also falls. We find heterogeneous responses of regional GDP with a median increase of 0.1% in one year that falls to 0.02% in the long run.

I revisit the productivity slowdown debate by estimating the capital-labor elasticity and the bias of technical change for the U.S. economy under four different models of technical change. One with constant growth rates, one with a structural break in the constant growth rates, one in which growth is linear, and one with flexible time-varying growth rates. I find evidence in support of non-constant growth rates of factor-augmenting technical change. Labor-augmenting technical change growth rates are decelerating, while capital-augmenting technical change is non negligible but vanishes quickly.

Contrary to the experience of industrialized countries, productivity growth of Indian services has been consistently faster than manufacturing. In this paper, I document that (i) the fastest growing industries in services grow faster than in manufacturing; (ii) faster productivity growth in services than in manufacturing is not because of sluggish manufacturing productivity; (iii) the supply of skilled workers in India is skewed towards tertiary education and (iv) the service sector is the most skill intensive; (v) returns to schooling are larger for the high-productivity services. To quantify and rationalize these facts, I construct a multi-sector model of structural change with high and low-skilled workers. The calibrated model suggests that the large supply of high-skill workers combined with higher skill intensity in the service sector seem to be behind the services take-off. The data imply that service sub-sectors are gross substitutes while manufacturing sub-sectors are gross complements. This will accelerate productivity growth in services and decelerate productivity growth in manufacturing.

We ask how much of the spatial evolution of structural transformation can be attributed to electrification and transportation improvements. We model jointly the endogenous evolution of transport and electricity networks in a multi-sector quantitative economic geography model for the case of Brazil. In our model, the government chooses infrastructure investments to maximize welfare. One key aspect is that sectoral TFPs are determined partly by roads access and electricity quality, the underlying assumption being that electricity access allows for a new menu of technologies that were not available before. Furthermore, firms can employ electricity as a production input which allows for differential sectoral impact of electricity use. We estimate the sectoral TFPs elasticities with respect to population density, quality of electricity, and quality of roads. We find these to be the largest in services. Agriculture and manufacturing benefit more from the quality of electricity rather than from agglomeration or quality of roads.

**An Economic Geography Model of COVID-19 for Europe**

We study the spatial dynamics of COVID-19 through the lens of an epidemiological model incorporated into a multi-sector economic geography model that allows for trade in intermediate goods. The model proceeds in two phases. During the first phase, in each location and moment of time, the population structure (susceptible, infected, resolving, recovered, dead) is taken as given and we solve for the spatial distribution of economic activity and trade flows. In a second phase, we determine how the population structure evolves as the virus spreads. We extend the epidemiological model to account for endogenously determined spatial linkages. We assume that the number of infected people in a location depends on the number of infected people in the regions that it trades with. Furthermore, since the population structure changes from one day to the next, we assume that the workforce is affected by the number of deaths. In the model, each region and sector pair uses intermediate inputs from other sectors which generates an amplification mechanism of regional specific policies. We study how social distancing through telematic work and regional specific lockdown policies affect the spread and prevalence of the disease and their economic impact. We find that regional-specific lockdowns based on the local incidence of the disease are the most successful in saving lives and reducing the impact on the economy.
