Contrary to the experience of industrialized countries, productivity growth of Indian services has been consistently faster than manufacturing. In this paper, I document that (i) the fastest growing industries in services grow faster than in manufacturing; (ii) faster productivity growth in services than in manufacturing is not because of sluggish manufacturing productivity; (iii) the supply of skilled workers in India is skewed towards tertiary education and (iv) the service sector is the most skill intensive; (v) returns to schooling are larger for the high-productivity services. To quantify and rationalize these facts, I construct a multi-sector model of structural change with high and low-skilled workers. The calibrated model suggests that the large supply of high-skill workers combined with higher skill intensity in the service sector seem to be behind the services take-off. The data imply that service sub-sectors are gross substitutes while manufacturing sub-sectors are gross complements. This will accelerate productivity growth in services and decelerate productivity growth in manufacturing.

The decline in the labor share has attracted the attention of economists in recent years. Empirical literature has found that this decline can be explained by the increasing capital intensity of the U.S. economy. This paper proposes a mechanism that accounts for the increasing capital intensity - the slowdown of labor augmenting technology. To asses the empirical validity of this mechanism, I build a general equilibrium model with a CES production function, a utility function compatible with decreasing hours of work, and use a supply-side system to estimate the parameters of the model. I simulate the solution of the model using the actual series for the exogenous variables and I find that the model can account for between half and almost the full decline, depending on the particular specification considered.

We study the spatial dynamics of COVID-19 through the lens of an epidemiological model incorporated into a multi-sector economic geography model that allows for trade in intermediate goods. The model proceeds in two phases. During the first phase, in each location and moment of time, the population structure (susceptible, infected, resolving, recovered, dead) is taken as given and we solve for the spatial distribution of economic activity and trade flows. In a second phase, we determine how the population structure evolves as the virus spreads. We extend the epidemiological model to account for endogenously determined spatial linkages. We assume that the number of infected people in a location depends on the number of infected people in the regions that it trades with. Furthermore, since the population structure changes from one day to the next, we assume that the workforce is affected by the number of deaths. In the model, each region and sector pair uses intermediate inputs from other sectors which generates an amplification mechanism of regional specific policies. We study how social distancing through telematic work and regional specific lockdown policies affect the spread and prevalence of the disease and their economic impact. We find that regional-specific lockdowns based on the local incidence of the disease are the most successful in saving lives and reducing the impact on the economy.

**Spatial Complementarities in Public Infrastructure and Structural Transformation in Brazil** (Joint with [Fidel Pérez-Sebastián](http://fae.ua.es/FAEX/perez-sebastianfidel/) and [Jevgenijs Steinbuks](http://www.steinbuks.info/))

We ask how much of the spatial evolution of structural transformation can be attributed to electrification and transportation improvements. We model jointly the endogenous evolution of transport and electricity networks in a multi-sector quantitative economic geography model for the case of Brazil. In our model, the government chooses infrastructure investments to maximize welfare. One key aspect is that sectoral TFPs are determined partly by roads access and electricity quality, the underlying assumption being that electricity access allows for a new menu of technologies that were not available before. Furthermore, firms can employ electricity as a production input which allows for differential sectoral impact of electricity use. We estimate the sectoral TFPs elasticities with respect to population density, quality of electricity, and quality of roads. We find these to be the largest in services. Agriculture and manufacturing benefit more from the quality of electricity rather than from agglomeration or quality of roads.
