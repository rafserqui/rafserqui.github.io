I revisit the productivity slowdown debate by estimating the capital-labor elasticity and the bias of technical change for the U.S. economy under four different models of technical change. One with constant growth rates, one with a structural break in the constant growth rates, one in which growth is linear, and one with flexible time-varying growth rates. I find evidence in support of non-constant growth rates of factor-augmenting technical change. Labor-augmenting technical change growth rates are decelerating, while capital-augmenting technical change is non negligible but vanishes quickly.

A broad literature highlights efficiency gains due to cost reduction after privatizations in the energy sector. However, to the best of our knowledge, this literature does not develop general equilibrium models, which are fundamental to account for post-privatization gains from a regional perspective. This paper evaluates the increase in efficiency necessary to make the privatization of a natural gas local distribution company (LDC) worthwhile in a state-level fiscal sense. We propose a general equilibrium model representing a regional economy supplied by a monopolistic LDC, whose ownership is shared between the private sector and federal and state governments. The model is calibrated for 13 of the major Brazilian LDCs using their financial and operational data, as well as regional economic data. We find that the necessary unit cost reduction varies between LDCs, with a median value of 4.4% and values ranging from 0.2% to 22.9%.

This paper investigates the short and long run effects of increased competition in the provision of natural gas. We build a dynamic general equilibrium model with monopolistic distribution of natural gas and calibrate it to 12 major Brazilian local distribution companies. We find that reductions in the price of natural gas can lead to sustained and significant increases of natural gas in the energy mix. A 5% reduction in the price of natural gas leads to a median increase in the consumption of natural gas of 5.5% and moderate GDP gains between 0.03% and 0.16%. Our model highlights mechanisms for energy transitions showing that moderate declines in natural gas prices can lead to sustained long-run increases in the share of natural gas consumption.

Contrary to the experience of industrialized countries, productivity growth of Indian services has been consistently faster than manufacturing. In this paper, I document that (i) the fastest growing industries in services grow faster than in manufacturing; (ii) faster productivity growth in services than in manufacturing is not because of sluggish manufacturing productivity; (iii) the supply of skilled workers in India is skewed towards tertiary education and (iv) the service sector is the most skill intensive; (v) returns to schooling are larger for the high-productivity services. To quantify and rationalize these facts, I construct a multi-sector model of structural change with high and low-skilled workers. The calibrated model suggests that the large supply of high-skill workers combined with higher skill intensity in the service sector seem to be behind the services take-off. The data imply that service sub-sectors are gross substitutes while manufacturing sub-sectors are gross complements. This will accelerate productivity growth in services and decelerate productivity growth in manufacturing.

We ask how much of the spatial evolution of structural transformation can be attributed to electrification and transportation improvements. We model jointly the endogenous evolution of transport and electricity networks in a multi-sector quantitative economic geography model for the case of Brazil. In our model, the government chooses infrastructure investments to maximize welfare. One key aspect is that sectoral TFPs are determined partly by roads access and electricity quality, the underlying assumption being that electricity access allows for a new menu of technologies that were not available before. Furthermore, firms can employ electricity as a production input which allows for differential sectoral impact of electricity use. We estimate the sectoral TFPs elasticities with respect to population density, quality of electricity, and quality of roads. We find these to be the largest in services. Agriculture and manufacturing benefit more from the quality of electricity rather than from agglomeration or quality of roads.

**An Economic Geography Model of COVID-19 for Europe**

We study the spatial dynamics of COVID-19 through the lens of an epidemiological model incorporated into a multi-sector economic geography model that allows for trade in intermediate goods. The model proceeds in two phases. During the first phase, in each location and moment of time, the population structure (susceptible, infected, resolving, recovered, dead) is taken as given and we solve for the spatial distribution of economic activity and trade flows. In a second phase, we determine how the population structure evolves as the virus spreads. We extend the epidemiological model to account for endogenously determined spatial linkages. We assume that the number of infected people in a location depends on the number of infected people in the regions that it trades with. Furthermore, since the population structure changes from one day to the next, we assume that the workforce is affected by the number of deaths. In the model, each region and sector pair uses intermediate inputs from other sectors which generates an amplification mechanism of regional specific policies. We study how social distancing through telematic work and regional specific lockdown policies affect the spread and prevalence of the disease and their economic impact. We find that regional-specific lockdowns based on the local incidence of the disease are the most successful in saving lives and reducing the impact on the economy.
