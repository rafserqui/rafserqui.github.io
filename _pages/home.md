Hello, I am Rafael Serrano-Quintero, a postdoctoral researcher at the [**Department of Economic Theory**](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/) at the [**University of Barcelona**](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/en/).

I got my PhD from the [**Department of Economics (FAE)**](http://fae.ua.es/FAEX/?lang=es) at the University of Alicante in 2021.

My research interests are macroeconomics, economic growth, development, and structural change. I am also working on spatial models of economic development.
